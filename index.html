        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2> What is a Microbial Fingerprint?</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">A microbial fingerprint is made up of the unique combinations of bacteria and viruses living on a particular surface. Anything can have a microbial fingerprint -- phone screen, door nobs, and city subways. The microbial fingerprint is gathered by taking a swab from the surface in question, and then using a next generation sequencing machine to determine the DNA found in the swab. The amount of bacteria in the samples is much greater than the amount of viruses, because viruses are smaller and much harder to detect. However, this is the case for every sample so when comparing them to each other the amount of viruses does not affect the analysis.</p>
        <h2> Comparing Subway Microbial Fingerprints</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">The purpose of this project is to compare the microbial fingerprint of Boston, New York City and Sacramento. The subways from these three cities were swabbed by different labs and the data was acquired from blah and blah. In order to compare the microbial fingerprints of subways to a control group, the microbial fingerprint from a human mouth is also included in this project. The data was acquired from blah. The accompanying interactive visuals are intended to illustrate the similarities between the different microbial fingerprints. Click on the 3 visuals below to interact with them and explore the subway microbes! </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Conclusions</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Boston's Microbial Fingerprint</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left"> On average the Orange line had the greatest abundance of pathogenic microbes. This can be seen in the 'MBTA Microbes' visual. The orange bubbles are on average larger than the green and red. The 'cleanest' line is the Green Line. The Green line has the smallest ridership numbers accourding to the MBTA Service and Infrastructure Profile. This may account for its lack of microbes. The ridership/microbe theory applies to the Red Line and Orange Line as well because the Orange Line has more riders than the Red Line. </p>
        <h2>City Comparisons</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left"> The City with the most microbes is blah. The annual subway riders in blah city is blah. This does/does not fit the riderships/microbe trend. </p>
        <h2>Subway vs Mouth</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">The most noteable microbes the subway has in common with a human mouth are blah blah blah. The high abundance of these microbes in human mouths could acount for their high abundance on the subway. The microbes could travel from riders mouths to their hands onto to the subway handles. Or the mouth microbes could be transferred when a rider coughs, sneezes etc. </p>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">Regardless of their presence on the subway, many microbes are constantly present in our mouths. Our immune systems keep us from constantly getting sick. In conclusion, although dangerous microbes are present on the subway they do not pose a huge threat to riders as long as the rider's have a healthy immune system. Practicing basic hygeine can also further protect riders from subway microbes. For example, after riding the subway riders can wash their hands. </p>
        <h2> Problems with the Data</h2>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">These datasets were collected by different labs. Each lab used their own sequencing machine and data collection protocols. In addition I used my own protocl when converting the mouth samples to a usuable format. The dispartity in method across samples introduces some error. In an ideal world, all the data would have been collected and processed by the same lab using the same methods. </p>
        <p class="text-muted align-text-left">Furthermore, not all of the city datasets included what part of the subway car was sampled. For example, one sample could be taken from the subway handle, while another could be taken from the subway seat. When comparing the city datasets it is possible that different subway car locations are being compared across each city. Therefore some of the differences/similarities across cities could be due to the location of the sample and not the city itself. In my analysis, I assumed possible subway car location disparities were negligent. Again, in a perfect world all the samples would be taken from analagous subway car locations. </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"> Urban takeaways</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="color:white">Recent technological advancements have made it exponentially easier to profile microbial fingerprints. The Metasub Project is slowly but surely collecting the microbial fingerprints from subway cars around the world… but why do they care about this data? </p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="color:white">It is a fact of life that there will be at least some harmful microbes in any environment. The point of collecting this data is not to show how dirty the world is or to discourage people from taking the subway. Similarly, the purpose of this project is not to show that Boston’s subways are dirty and should be cleaned more. As illustrated in the Subway vs Mouth visual, harmful microbes are living inside us already, but ultimately aren’t harmful. Instead, the point of this project is to show how microbial fingerprints reflect the lives of the city inhabitants. Any time someone passes through an area they leave a little bit of their microbial fingerprint behind to contribute to the greater "city microbial fingerprint." These microbes can answer questions about where citizens are from, where they are going, and how they interact with their city. </p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="color:white">I suspect the increased microbial diversity in [insert city] is a product of the comparatively greater ridership numbers in that subway system. In other words, the more people who ride the subways, the more opportunities there are for new microbes to be introduced. Similarly, the Orange Line has many more riders than the Green Line, and also more microbes. I chose the cities Boston, Sacramento, and New York because they were readily available. However, as more data from the Metasub Project becomes available the data can be used to further analyze the ridership patterns of subways all over the world. </p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="color:white">In addition, if microbial samples are taken from a certain subway system at different increments throughout the day/week, the microbial patterns can be used to track riders throughout different lines. I worked on a project with a similar concept to this last year. I used the microbial fingerprints of high school bathrooms and the doorknobs of different classrooms to track students around the school. I believe with enough datasets a similar setup can be used to also track people around a city. </p>
        <p class="align-text-left" style="color:white"> In conclusion, the takeaway from this project is that no two subway microbial fingerprints are the same in the same way that no two subway cars have the same riders. Microbial fingerprint data have incredible potential to unlock information about the lives of the people represented in the fingerprint. I look forward to more microbial datasets becoming available and analyzed in depth. I am eager to play a part in discoveries from these types of data. This project has inspired me to pursue a “Northeastern Microbiome” project this summer. I am planning to sequence the microbial fingerprints of different areas around campus  (eg: Snell Library Computers, Hurtig Hall doorknobs) to see what the microbial communities say about the habits of the Northeastern community. </p>

              <p>Looking at subway bacteria on its own can be extremely daunting without a control group to compare it to. This visual allows you to compare a normal human mouth to the Boston subway. Even though there are harmful germs constantly living in our mouths we are not always sick. This is because our immune systems protect us. Therefore, we do not have to be that worried about the dangerous microbes on subways. As long as we wash our hands and keep our immune system strong, subway microbes should not bother us. </p>
